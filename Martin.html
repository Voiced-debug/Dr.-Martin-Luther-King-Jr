            <p>Here is the citation read at the event of presentation of his Presidential Medal of Freedom</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of
                    love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our 
                    humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better.
                    His dreams sustains us yet
                </p>

                <cite>-- President Jimmy Carter</cite>
